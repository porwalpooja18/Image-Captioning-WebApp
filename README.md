# Image-Captioning-WebApp

This project involves the development of an Image Captioning model that generates contextually relevant captions for input images. It combines advanced deep learning techniques with a user-friendly web interface for practical application.

## Features

- Encoder Decoder Architecture: Combines ResNet50 for feature extraction with a language processing model to generate captions.

- Transfer Learning: Utilized to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model.

- Web Deployment: The model is deployed as a web application using Flask.

- User-Friendly Interface: The application features a clean and intuitive design using HTML and CSS.

## Tech Stack

Backend: TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Visualization and Processing: Matplotlib, OpenCV

Natural Language Processing: NLTK

## Web Application:

Flask serves as the backend framework.

User interactions and image uploads are handled through a simple HTML/CSS frontend.

## Results

The model generates accurate and contextually relevant captions for a variety of images, showcasing its ability to understand and describe visual content effectively.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional feature extraction architectures.

- Improve the language model by fine-tuning with advanced NLP models.

- Add multilingual support for caption generation.

- Enhance the UI for better user experience.

Thank you for exploring the Image Captioning WebApp!
